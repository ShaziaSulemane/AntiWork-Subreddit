When calling the help desk, I was told my hiring manager had not accepted my submitted information so there was not an account set up. Because of this I would need to talk to my manager. I contacted my manager with what help desk informed me of and was abruptly told that, \"Only you could fix this issue.

I received a phone call about an hour later stating I would not be given those hours and that \"it causes problems for them when we discuss our pay rate\" so if I could not talk about it please.

There's vali\u00f0 arguments there.\n\nI'm more concerned with sticking metal objects into a breaker box to Jimmy it open. This increases the risk of electrocution exponentially. All you need to do is h\u00e6 e said object Come into contact with the bus bar in the panel, and all of a sudden you become the load and are hit with 120-240 volts if you're lucky. But being that it's a commercial establishment, the lighting is probably 277-480 volts. In the trade we call 277 the widow maker, mostly because it's not 120 volts, and not quite as high as 480 volts, and people forget that it is pretty dangerous still.\n\nMore sparkies die to 277 than 120, 240, or 480 volts. It's purely anecdotal on my end, but it's something I've heard echoed many times throughout the years and in OSHA class.\n\nBottom line, risking anything coming into contact with that bus will either electrocute you, killing you, or arc flashing so bad, that it cooks your skin, and vaporizes the air and burns your lungs as you breath it in, and you'd wish you died.\n\nHope this is a better answer.

Is this common?\n\nTo put things in context, I work in a management position in the property restoration industry. My salary is very low and there are little to no benefits, the majority of my compensation comes from commission. I was hired in my current role with the promise of unlimited earning potential through commission, if I make the company more money then I get paid more money as a percentage of those profits. \n\nI was hired with the expectation that I would be making really good money within two years depending on how well the company did under me. Well, it did. Within a year of my being hired we were taking on more jobs and making more money than ever before. For over a year and a half my commission steadily increased each quarter accordingly. The company owners are really shady though and I had a bad feeling about them actually paying me what I'm owed. Then, a year and a half in, it finally happened. We got paid out for an absolutely massive job at the end of our best quarter ever and when it came time to cut me my check, they paid me less than half of what I was owed. When I confronted them about it, they said that I was making more than they expected and that my job shouldn't be paying so much. Dude, I'm making a percentage of the profits. If I'm making that much then they're making waaaaayyyyy more. I'm also doing the work of what any other company would have 4-5 people doing and I've been on call 24/7 with no days off for two years straight.\n\nThe last company that I worked for pulled the same thing. I was a project manager with a low salary and no benefits but with commission on the profits of my jobs. So I busted my ass and made the company a ton of money growing sales and profits in my department by 175% in a year. When my commission checks reached a certain point they went back and rewrote the entire commission structure to make it so that what I took home was cut down by a third saying that, \"The position was never meant to pay that much.\" I was making a percentage of profits on my jobs. Isn't that what they want, someone to make the company a ton of money and get paid more in line with that? When I left they had to hire three people to replace me and are still struggling. \n\nSo now as I'm looking for another job where I can work hard at a company and potentially make a lot of money in commission/performance based bonuses I'm wondering, is it worth it? Is it just the standard thing to cap an employee's earnings even if those earnings are commission based? I tend to live my job and I don't want to put all of my time and effort into a company where there are going to be diminishing returns on my effort or where the reward for making them a lot of money is always going to be more and more work for less pay. Better to just take a job with an ok salary and no commission and not put in that much work. \n\ntldr: Twice I made the company I worked for a lot of money which resulted in a big commission check that the company didn't want to pay.

They weren't in so the front desk took a message and they'll get back to me sometime this week. I will do what I need to to let Supervisor know he cannot threaten my coworkers and crew and get away with it.\n\nA sidenote: I've already got a new job, and my last day is this Sunday.

Rule one, know your commissions. (Meaning understand how you get paid down to the dime. Memorized. When you\u2019re at a restaurant and you ask the server should I get dish A or dish B, that server should know which cost more and which has more upsell potential and suggest that one. Because they\u2019re paid on tips, which is a percentage of the bill) 2. Know your product (same example as the first. If you suggest the fried chicken you\u2019re not selling wine with it.

I was contacted for an interview via email by a recruiter. I disclosed my disabilities and asked for reasonable accommodations to perform the interview. I didn't hear anything and the recruiter ghosted me. Weeks later, I contacted a higher up in the department, I mentioned what happened and that I requested disability accommodations, but the recruiter never got back with me. The higher up stated the department was overwhelmed with work and that's why the recruiter never answered me. (Yet, a mutual acquaintance told me the recruiter was busy making public posts on his personal social media during that entire time.)\n\n**#3**, During email conversations about the reasonable disability accommodations request for the interview, the recruiter and higher up insisted that I perform a video interview so somebody could \"observe me\" and stated so we know that nobody else is answering the interview questions for you. (Yet, they don't require that for non-disabled applicants via telephone interviews. How do they know somebody performing a telephone interview isn't using someone else to answer their questions?)\n\n**#4**, When I told them those accommodations wouldn't work and explained why they wouldn't work because of my specific disabilities, the department head was condescending, treated me like I'm unintelligent and asked if I understood her modification of the reasonable accommodation request.\n\n**#5**, For the first interview I was supposed to receive important information I needed for that interview via email. I waited 15 minutes for the information and for somebody to contact me to start the interview. Reason they were so late--they sent the information to the wrong email.\n\n**#6**, During the follow up interview questions, the subject matter experts questioned my response about software systems that I have experience using. They claimed the systems that I mentioned didn't perform the specifications that they asked about, when they absolutely do.\n\n**#7**, I'm self-employed. I have it listed on my resume and also listed it on the two/three(?) different applications that they required me to fill out. They wouldn't accept any reference that wasn't a supervisor.

They tend to hold as a core axiom that competitive markets and free markets are one in the same, i.e. that the \"natural state\" of the markets are highly competitive, and if there is a lack of competition, it must be an \"unnatural state\", i.e. there is some sort of top-down interference, government policies, which restrict competition.\n\nLibertarians thus see cronyism as happening from the top-down, where governments interfere with the markets, create monopolies, and all for the purpose of enriching themselves. Hence, they conclude the problem is government, that you have to get rid of government and then the problems will be solved.\n\nThis is the direct opposite view of Marxists. Marxists instead argue that markets inherently lead to a gradual increase in monopolization over time, what Marx referred to as the \"laws of the concentration and centralization of capitals\", and that market economies have a natural tendency to move more and more away from competition over time.\n\nMore than this, Marxists also see political power as not ultimately originating from the superstructure of society (the politics), but instead from the base of society (the economics). Any government policy requires enforcement, but any enforcement inherently presupposes an economic system which can produce tools of enforcement and allocate them appropriately to the enforcers. Politics is inherently derivative of economics.\n\nThe reason the political system favors the wealthy is not because of some laws implemented by some evil cabal that if they were just abolished, then capitalism would \"work\". No, the reason the political system favors the wealthy is because the wealthy are the ones who control society's wealth, and so of course the political system will favor them.\n\nNo law you write on a piece of paper will make a billionaire like Jeff Bezos have equal political influence as a minimum wage worker barely making ends meet. Production is the most fundamental basis of human society and those who control production control society's wealth and will inevitably have more influence. Even if you write laws saying bribery is illegal then they can just bribe those who enforce it.\n\nHence, Marxists do not see cronyism as a result of top-down processes implemented by a corrupt superstructure, by some evil cabal within the government that corrupted \"*true* capitalism\" and turned it into cronyism.\n\nRather, Marxists see cronyism as originating from a bottom-up process, that stems from the economic base in and of itself. Markets inevitably lead over time to greater and greater monopolization, creating a larger and larger gap between the working masses and the capitalists, and even if there is a \"rising tide\" and workers' wages rise as well, the profits of capital increase disproportionality faster, and capital continues to centralize rapidly, leading to an increasing social chasm between the rich and the poor.\n\nThis is why libertarianism/conservatism has never worked in history and will never work. They *can't* get rid of \"big government\" because the economic base, capitalism, inherently creates an enormous social divide, enormous polarization in the economy. This enormous wealth inequality naturally translates to power inequality, which then allows the capitalists to capture the state for their interests.\n\nOnce the capitalists capture the state, there is no reason for them *not* to implement \"big government\" but for their own benefit, i.e. corporate bailouts and subsidies and such. Libertarian policies, hence, in practice, ***always lead to \"big government\"***. Never in human history have they actually achieved their goals, because their goals are fundamentally impossible and self-contradictory.\n\nAnother separate point is that these people also have a tendency to water down what \"capitalism\" means. Capitalism is about ***capital***, that's why it's called ***capital***ism. This refers to a specific kind of society dominated by capital, i.e. production for profit. Libertarians like water down \"capitalism\" to refer specifically just to trade or markets, but capitalism is not tradeism or marketism. It's capitalism. Pre-capitalist economies have had trade and markets and so have socialist economies.\n\n--\n\ncredit to aimixin", "created": 1677712238.0, "parent_id": "t3_11fkevg", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 39}, {"id": "jaknewd", "author": "zalinth37920", "body": "It's not really a trick if everyone knows it's bullshit.

These so-called \u201csystems\u201d that keep people poor are easily avoided by making smart choices.\n\n\r\n\nI'm writing this out because I see this all the time and this mindset really bothers me. You seem like a reasonable person from some of your replies so I thought you might be open minded to some ideas that disagree with you. \n\nI'm sorry for the incoming wall of text, but it's because reality cannot be aptly explained in a single sentence like \"poor people are poor because they're stupid.\" I understand how you might come to this conclusion, but I disagree, and I hope to provide some food-for-thought that you could at least ponder. \r  \n\r\n\nLet's start with something simple. One of the best predictors for your level of wealth, as well as health, is the Zip code that you are born in. \n\n[https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/](https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/)\n\n[https://www.lisc.org/our-resources/resource/opportunity-atlas-shows-effect-childhood-zip-codes-adult-success/](https://www.lisc.org/our-resources/resource/opportunity-atlas-shows-effect-childhood-zip-codes-adult-success/)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468120288/a-look-at-the-wealth-and-income-gap-by-zip-code](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468120288/a-look-at-the-wealth-and-income-gap-by-zip-code)\n\nA human born in a rich area and a human born in a poor area have no fundamental differences at birth, other than something like if the poor mother is malnourished, which is just another disadvantage for the poor child. A poor baby and a rich baby are just two specimens of the same species, homo sapiens, with the exact same amount of potential, on average.\r\n\nSo, naturally, the next question you need to ask is if these children have, on average, the same amount of potential, then why do the ones from poor families, on average, end up making way more \"stupid decisions\" after they grow up, than children from rich families? Why do people from poor families end up poor so much more often than people from rich families? Is there some fundamental intrinsic difference in the level of stupidity between a person born in a wealthy zip code and a person born in a poor zip code? \n\nThis is where we need to move away from **individualistic** thinking and move towards **systemic** thinking. Humans are not individual creatures in a vacuum. They exist as nodes within bigger systems, whether it be as small as their family, or as large as the world itself. The state of society plays an instrumental role in the state of each human. \r\n\nThe main difference between someone who ends up making good decisions and someone who ends up making bad decisions is their environment. The specifics of their environment, from birth to adulthood, and even after. The level of opportunity that a person has access to is crucial to the development of a well adjusted, intelligent, thoughtful adult able to make smart choices.\r\n\nThere are an unexplainable, incalculable number of ways that growing up in a well-off (not even rich) family will aid in the development of a person as they grow. All the way through every single stage of development, the child from the family with more money and in a better area has monumental advantages. This cannot be overstated. \n\n[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-rich-parents-have-rich-children](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-rich-parents-have-rich-children)\n\nHumans are not bastions of free will and rationality that make decisions in vacuum. They are greatly affected by the circumstances that surround them. People born in an arbitrary zip code are not inherently more stupid than people born in some other zip code, therefore there **must** be something else that explains the outcomes of individuals. \n\nOne of the biggest problems with individualistic thinking is that it doesn't actually make any headway when it comes to solving societal problems. In a basic sense, if you believe that poor people are poor because they are stupid, you will logically conclude that there will always be a significant portion of the population that is destined to be stupid and poor. This means that you will not take steps to actually fix the problems that are causing poverty and suffering. \n\nI could be wrong about all of this. Maybe some people are actually inherently more stupid and should be poor, regardless of the systems that impact them. If we take this position as true... what do we do about poverty? We shouldn't do anything, really, since poor people deserve to be poor. After all, if they just decided to make smarter choices, they wouldn't be poor, right? So we now believe that nothing needs to be done to solve these issues. Even if we wanted to, what steps would we take? How do we even begin to make an impact on the issue without recognizing the influence of systems?\n\nIt's impossible to effectively apply individualistic solutions to systemic problems. It's in the name. \n\nWith that being said, I don't think I'm wrong. There's a reason that people have been progressively getting more intelligent compared to previous generations, and it's because they have better access to nutrition, education, stability, opportunity, and a host of other factors. That's the difference between the present and 300 years ago. Humans don't pop out of the womb inherently smarter now than they did 300 years ago. The difference is explained through the existence of a much better framework to develop people's intelligence and turn them into better decision makers. The same will be true for the future. \n\nIf we *enable* and *empower* people to make better decisions, they will. Period. Most people are just normal people doing the best they can with what they know. \n\nSo, again, sorry for the absolute mountain of text but systems and systemic problems are complex. It can't be adequately explained in a paragraph or two. I hope I made sense, and I hope this idea will be something you at least consider.", "created": 1677769891.0, "parent_id": "t1_jallcz9", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 1}, {"id": "jajtinm", "author": "spectralSpirograph", "body": "Closest thing to an irl Sith lord, alongside Charles Koch", "created": 1677711634.0, "parent_id": "t1_jajszm6", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 72}, {"id": "jamxc8g", "author": "iWantBoebertNudes", "body": "BRB buying a ticket to Annapolis to piss on Reagan\u2019s grave.", "created": 1677773313.0, "parent_id": "t1_jajszm6", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 4}, {"id": "jalvb8s", "author": "Inner-Mechanic", "body": "If aliens invade, I'm immediately switching sides.

Which is huge in terms of being able to cope with it. Which being said, the VA has tons of open resources for people to use, and refer to on the topic, and even SAMSHA often refers to them on the topic; \n\nhttps://www.ptsd.va.gov/gethelp/selfhelp_coping.asp\n\nhttps://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand_tx/tx_basics.asp\n\n\nFor me what helps during an episode is to try and meditate through it. Take deep breaths, and not let the stress reaction carry me away. Being able to recognize the symptoms and causes of an episode therein can also help with taking action to moderate, or even prevent the worst of the symptoms before things escalate too far.\n\nSource: Formerly self employed, and spent years in finding resolution to all sorts of self induced stress related problems.

A while back, I got promoted to supervisor (a $.50 raise and no benefits, yay!). In the beginning, the doctor told me \"I want you to be my second brain\". A severe red flag but I was excited about my promotion so I didn't really think anything of it. Once my promotion was established, she began to pick apart and question everything single thing I did. She was extremely insecure about how her clinic looked so she wanted to control every single detail she possibly could from social media posts to patient interactions to phone calls. \n\nShe started harassing me for every single missed phone call, email, and social media message that wasn't answered in a \"timely manner\". Meanwhile, I was training new hires, researching and designing merch for our first event, running errands for her (getting cupcakes and flowers for *every single* patient's birthday), answering all phone calls, scheduling patients, handling paperwork, supervising others, keeping track of finances, and overall exhaustingly running the place. I was doing everything I could to keep her from breathing down my neck. The event we were preparing for was going to require us to work 11 days in a row with no paid OT, and she was planning on doing these events twice a month. I was dreading it. \n\nYesterday, she lectured me about one unanswered email in front of my peers, questioned whether I was training the new hire correctly, and finally, she blamed me for a door dash order being late and for it being delivered to the wrong address even though I had put in the right address on the order. At that moment I realized nothing was ever going to please her and the stress was not worth the $.50 raise. It was an accumulation of all of the micromanaging bs that led to that final decision. It's the first time I have ever quit on the spot. \n\nThe most aggravating part about it was that she boasted that she was caring for her community and she loved helping people get better but underneath it all, she was just another capitalist business owner scrounging for more and more money while taking advantage of her employees and shaming other clinics for being poor.", "created": 1677702822.0, "comments": [{"id": "jajvccq", "author": "Appropriate_Tree1668", "body": "Dodged a bullet working for a psychopath.", "created": 1677712393.0, "parent_id": "t3_11fh5ig", "link_id": "t3_11fh5ig", "score": 4}]}, {"id": "11fh58j", "title": "Wanna pick up dead bodies and not make enough to pay your rent?

The role I was told I would eventually have was to be a salaried position of Marketing & Social Media Manager and starting salary would be $55k a year. I was ecstatic, as this was my dream job and far more money I had made at my previous job. \n\nI started in February and was told I would start part time while I learned the ins and outs of property management, since I had absolutely no experience in this field. During my \"training period\" they offered me $15.00 an hour. I was offended, and I was pissed. I argued that the initial offer was a salary of $55k, I again was assured I would make that once I was hired into the position that they were now calling, \"Digital Communications Specialist\". I reluctantly agreed to the training wage. \n\nIn May, I was STILL working as a temp, now doing leasing part time, and learning my new role at the corporate office that was now called \"Social Media Coordinator\", and still only making $15 an hour. The property manager where I was learning leasing, had an emergency surgery and was suddenly and unexpectedly off work for 5 weeks. During that time, my Social Media Coordinator position was put on hold, and I was thrown into the position of Temporary Property Manager, and still making $15 an hour. \n\nFINALLY, in October of 2021, I am told I will be coming to the corporate office as the full time Social Media Coordinator. I am happy, excited, and beyond ready! My first full day at the corporate office starts and I am looking over all of my paperwork for the new position when I suddenly see \"Rate of Pay: $16.50/Hourly. I am no math genius, but I know that this does not equate to $55k a year. \n\nI immediately go to my direct supervisor; she is as shocked as I am as she was told my rate of pay would be higher and vows to get to the bottom of this. I continue on about my week, right before I should be receiving my first paycheck, I am called into a meeting. I come in and our Human Resources Manager and my direct supervisor are sitting at the table. I sit down and I am told that because I am taking benefits, it has reduced my salary, the $55k that I was quoted was the entire compensation package which includes benefits, and vacation time. Also, since the position was new to the company, they were making it an hourly position until a time where I would require additional assistance and they would move me to a management position and hire someone under me to take on my current role. I asked how far in the future this plan was and they said within a year or two. I was immediately disappointed and asked if I could think about this and give them an answer the next day and they said yes. \n\nI reluctantly accepted the lower offer, as it was more than I made at my previous job, would give me the experience I wanted, and seemingly was leading to a management position. Within the first couple of months in my new position, I had increased social media traffic, I had helped increase occupancy at all 25 of their properties, and I had implemented many things to help streamline and modernize their business. I also built them a website from scratch for a domain that they had purchased but never utilized. I was praised at the end of the year holiday party for my work and the Vice President pulled me aside personally and told me he was very happy with my work and they the coming year would lead to great things for me. I assumed he meant a promotion. \n\nJanuary came and new move ins slowed at all properties. All of a sudden, the VP was wondering if my position was adding value to the company. I was still doing everything I had done previously, but move ins were slowing, so it must have been my fault. It obviously can't be that its January and no one wants to move in the dead of winter! Now, there was a sense of urgency for me to prove my worth. I met with my supervisor who told me she thought I was doing a wonderful job and that she would make sure that my worth was seen. However, In early February, I am told that there is a chance that my position could be cut to part-time, until move ins increased again. I could not afford to only work part time, so out of fear and needing a job that was more secure, I started looking for other employment opportunities.\n\nLater in February, I interviewed with a very large and well-known corporation and by mid-March, was offered the position I had interviewed for. I had to wait for some background checks and clearance to go through before I could start so they gave me a tentative start date of May 1st. Even so, I immediately informed my current employer that I would be leaving, and my last day would be April 29, 2022. They tried to get me to stay by now offering me the position I had held out for over a year. They offered me the $55k salary and my own office. But by this time, I had already checked out. Tired of being strung along, I declined their offer. \n\nAs my last day there approached, they asked if I would be willing to do contract work for them, in my own time, and they would pay me $25/hour. We came to an agreement that I would ONLY be available after 5PM and on weekends, UNLESS I let them know of times, I would not be available for vacation or family emergencies, etc. and they agreed. I started doing contract work for them when I left and it went great for the first several months. The extra money was great, it helped pay for my wedding in June of 2022, and allowed my husband and I to enjoy our summer without worrying so much about money. \n\nIn September, my husband and I were FINALLY able to plan our honeymoon, we had postponed it several times due to his company not allowing employees to take more than 2 days off in a row because they were extremely short staffed. I made the property management company aware that I would be traveling internationally in February and would be unavailable for that week, they had no issues, or so they said. \n\nJanuary 2023 rolled around and yet again, new move ins slowed and suddenly, there it was again, the question of if my position was adding value to the company or if it made more sense to split my tasks among people in the office. I plead my case as to the value I add. I showed my former supervisor how I created their content and posted it on social media, I showed her how I maintained the website, all of the things I did, and she said she didn't realize the time this all took up. Her and I had a lengthy discussion and she told me she would back me up and do what she could to keep this arrangement working. \n\nFebruary 9, 2023. The day before I leave for my honeymoon. I email SEVERAL people from the property management company: \"Good Morning everyone! As some of you know, I will be going to the Bahamas for my honeymoon, starting tomorrow. Because I will be traveling internationally, I will have limited service on my cell phone. This will make it very difficult for me to be reached and therefore I am going to say I will not be available until I return on 2/17/2023. If there is ANYTHING anyone needs, please let me know ASAP so that I can have everything wrapped up by the end of the day today. As always \\^%&( has access to the social media pages should there be anything that NEEDS to be posted or updated. Thanks!\"\n\nNO ONE told me of anything that was needed or anything they were planning to need during the time I was gone. In fact, EVERYONE I emailed replied and told me to have a great time and enjoy! So, I did. \n\nFebruary 19, 2023, I admittedly did not check my email until the Sunday after I got back. Nobody from the corporate office works weekends, so I figured there wasn't anything so pressing that it couldn't wait until Monday. Alas, Sunday night I checked my email to see that a property manager had emailed me some photos from Valentine's Day. I copied the photos and posted them to social media and then replied to her to let her know it was done. The next morning, I get an email from the property manager with several people CC'ed including her District Manager, the District Manager's boss, my supervisor, and the Vice President, asking why it took me 5 days to reply to her and that she wanted the photos posted ON valentine's day. I responded to her that I was on vacation and not available. I also reiterated that there are others on staff with access to Facebook and that they can be utilized in my absence, as I am entitled to vacation as is everyone else. \n\nI then receive a response from her boss stating that she doesn't think this situation is working with me being out of the office and not readily available when there are requests. She stated that she wanted to have a meeting with upper management to determine how this situation should continue and what was best for the business. I was absolutely flabbergasted. I could not believe someone was acting so unreasonable over a Facebook post. \n\nI immediately emailed just my supervisor and asked her what I should do or if I should wait until they met, and she told me to wait. That she too had access to the social media accounts but was also off on the day that the request was emailed. So, I waited. After about 2 hours, I received a text from my supervisor asking if she could call me, so I said yes. She called immediately and told me that the biggest issue property managers have is my availability and that I am not available during 9-5 business hours. it was requested of me to respond to all emails within 2 hours of receiving them, even if just to acknowledge that it was received. I told her no. I have a full-time job from 8-5 and that our initial deal was that I would do work for them AFTER 5. I refused to jeopardize my full time for a part time job that was quickly becoming more stressful than it was worth. I also stated that 1. If I had still worked full time for them, how would they feel about me doing another job while clocked in on their time. 2. If I was working for them full time, I would be entitled to a vacation and would still not have been available. Buying an international plan was $10 a day and unless they wanted to pay that, they cannot ask me to be available. 3. I told her that if this was the only way that this would continue, to work, then it would no longer work for me. \n\nShe said she understood, and she would talk to the VP to see what he wanted to do. and I said OK and we hung up. About 15 minutes later I received an email telling me to wrap up all my projects and to have everything done by March 1, 2023. I immediately went online and finished up everything I had in process, I removed myself from all of their social media accounts, and then submitted my final invoice and stated that there was no need to drag this on until March 1, 2023 as I no longer had access to their social media accounts and to let me know when I could come and pick up the payment for my last invoice. \n\nNO RESPONSE, but the next day I was removed from the Microsoft Office account. I texted my former supervisor and asked if she had received my invoice as I was no longer able to get into Outlook and she apologized, said she did not know they would remove me so quickly and that yes, my final payment would be available at the end of this week. \n\nNow, when I built their website, I branded it with my name and link to my own website where I am promoting my abilities to build and manage websites. They are asking me how to remove that because they don't want a link to a site they do not manage. I am also being asked, how I was able to streamline all of this work into a part-time position, as they do not see how anyone can take on all of this extra work. I don't know how to respond to their requests. I built their website and if you contracted a company to do that, their logo would be attached to it as well. They have even asked if they grant me temporary access, will I go in and just remove the link and I am very tempted to say yes and then delete their whole damn page! \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created": 1677701882.0, "comments": [{"id": "jajvbmk", "author": "Internal_Set_6564", "body": "You no longer work for them.

I asked how to do this and was given a web address and told to log in, using my person email and password, I had set on my application account. However that was incorrect as it didn't recognise the username or password. The managers assured me we just did it to soon and to wait a day or so.\n\n After 3 days of trying to log in as per their instruction and it not working, I got told to call and reset my password. When calling the help desk, I was told my hiring manager had not accepted my submitted information so there was not an account set up. Because of this I would need to talk to my manager. I contacted my manager with what help desk informed me of and was abruptly told that, \"Only you could fix this issue. We can't help you with this.\" I called help desk back and let them know what my managers had said, to this help desk escalated my complaint to I.T. this battle kept up for week, when I.T finally just pushed my account through.

That's a couple hundred dollars for me. I emailed both managers about this and was ignored. So I spoke up and was loud about not being paid properly to coworkers, which is fully legal where I'm from, even encouraged normally. All of a sudden management was on it. I received a phone call about an hour later stating I would not be given those hours and that \"it causes problems for them when we discuss our pay rate\" so if I could not talk about it please. My responce was I understand what your saying. Then the manager tried to talk me into taking a position 20 hours away from home for 6 months.

There's vali\u00f0 arguments there.\n\nI'm more concerned with sticking metal objects into a breaker box to Jimmy it open. This increases the risk of electrocution exponentially. All you need to do is h\u00e6 e said object Come into contact with the bus bar in the panel, and all of a sudden you become the load and are hit with 120-240 volts if you're lucky. But being that it's a commercial establishment, the lighting is probably 277-480 volts. In the trade we call 277 the widow maker, mostly because it's not 120 volts, and not quite as high as 480 volts, and people forget that it is pretty dangerous still.\n\nMore sparkies die to 277 than 120, 240, or 480 volts. It's purely anecdotal on my end, but it's something I've heard echoed many times throughout the years and in OSHA class.\n\nBottom line, risking anything coming into contact with that bus will either electrocute you, killing you, or arc flashing so bad, that it cooks your skin, and vaporizes the air and burns your lungs as you breath it in, and you'd wish you died.\n\nHope this is a better answer.

Is this common?\n\nTo put things in context, I work in a management position in the property restoration industry. My salary is very low and there are little to no benefits, the majority of my compensation comes from commission. I was hired in my current role with the promise of unlimited earning potential through commission, if I make the company more money then I get paid more money as a percentage of those profits. \n\nI was hired with the expectation that I would be making really good money within two years depending on how well the company did under me. Well, it did. Within a year of my being hired we were taking on more jobs and making more money than ever before. For over a year and a half my commission steadily increased each quarter accordingly. The company owners are really shady though and I had a bad feeling about them actually paying me what I'm owed. Then, a year and a half in, it finally happened. We got paid out for an absolutely massive job at the end of our best quarter ever and when it came time to cut me my check, they paid me less than half of what I was owed. When I confronted them about it, they said that I was making more than they expected and that my job shouldn't be paying so much. Dude, I'm making a percentage of the profits. If I'm making that much then they're making waaaaayyyyy more. I'm also doing the work of what any other company would have 4-5 people doing and I've been on call 24/7 with no days off for two years straight.\n\nThe last company that I worked for pulled the same thing. I was a project manager with a low salary and no benefits but with commission on the profits of my jobs. So I busted my ass and made the company a ton of money growing sales and profits in my department by 175% in a year. When my commission checks reached a certain point they went back and rewrote the entire commission structure to make it so that what I took home was cut down by a third saying that, \"The position was never meant to pay that much.\" I was making a percentage of profits on my jobs. Isn't that what they want, someone to make the company a ton of money and get paid more in line with that? When I left they had to hire three people to replace me and are still struggling. \n\nSo now as I'm looking for another job where I can work hard at a company and potentially make a lot of money in commission/performance based bonuses I'm wondering, is it worth it? Is it just the standard thing to cap an employee's earnings even if those earnings are commission based? I tend to live my job and I don't want to put all of my time and effort into a company where there are going to be diminishing returns on my effort or where the reward for making them a lot of money is always going to be more and more work for less pay. Better to just take a job with an ok salary and no commission and not put in that much work. \n\ntldr: Twice I made the company I worked for a lot of money which resulted in a big commission check that the company didn't want to pay.

Lots of traffic on this sidestreet, and it can be unsafe to cross during busy periods.\n\nThis week, Supervisor has decided to mandate that all employees park in the library's parking lot, or he will have their cars towed. Our parking lot is not a tow-away zone. I'm fairly certain that he cannot legally tow from it.\n\nThis is inaccessible to anyone that has any trouble walking long distances. Already multiple people have been late because they couldn't cross the street without risk of getting hit by a car.\n\nSo I did what I could, I went into the library, and asked to speak with someone in charge about it. They weren't in so the front desk took a message and they'll get back to me sometime this week. I will do what I need to to let Supervisor know he cannot threaten my coworkers and crew and get away with it.\n\nA sidenote: I've already got a new job, and my last day is this Sunday.

Aristotle Onassis once said \"The secret to business is to know something that no one else knows\" and this is as true today as it was when he said it. That's why we have 20 year old 'gurus' selling Amazon FBA courses all over the internet they are selling a standard business model claiming they've made millions with it (which is of course a lie). They make money from selling a course using deception.\n\nI wish you the best in your pursuit of freedom.", "created": 1677714799.0, "parent_id": "t3_11flwxt", "link_id": "t3_11flwxt", "score": 0}, {"id": "jajztaj", "author": "mistressbitcoin", "body": "Sounds like you need some sort of programming job,  even if it's not exactly web apps.", "created": 1677714289.0, "parent_id": "t3_11flwxt", "link_id": "t3_11flwxt", "score": 1}, {"id": "jak3z27", "author": "do2g", "body": "Have you tried Fiverr or topcoder?

Everything I hear about the turnover rate  and the recruitment/business practices has me a little nervous.\n\nThey  gave me the whole \"be your own boss\" pitch and that was a red flag at  the time, but I pulled through, thinking I would be able to make a  living. I'm not sure I will be able to, though. It's commissions only,  and everything I see from former employees implies they don't give you  ample leads and make you pay for everything out of pocket.\n\nI  keep seeing bad reviews from former employees, and everyone else in  sales I see talking about it seems to have bad things to say about it.  Thankfully, I didn't lose my job at the restaurant, but I did have my  hours cut back slightly (though, that will change in April).\n\nI  have another training session on Monday, and I'm having major second  thoughts.

I mean, technically it's true and the job does offer some flexibility, but you need to work consistently in order to build solid habits.

Rule one, know your commissions. (Meaning understand how you get paid down to the dime. Memorized. When you\u2019re at a restaurant and you ask the server should I get dish A or dish B, that server should know which cost more and which has more upsell potential and suggest that one. Because they\u2019re paid on tips, which is a percentage of the bill) 2. Know your product (same example as the first. If you suggest the fried chicken you\u2019re not selling wine with it. But if you suggest the steak you might sell a bottle of wine) 3. Know your presentation. (The customers don\u2019t want to listen to you. They think they know what they want. But if you\u2019re good, and ready to go, you\u2019ve got a moment to highlight the shit you want them to get without looking stupid. Learn that presentation back and forth. So you don\u2019t get stuck looking like a boob saying it the exact same way in front of two different customers) and rules 4-10 don\u2019t matter cause they don\u2019t make any money. \n\nThat\u2019s it! Now, once you know you\u2019re a salesman, those three rules are all that matters. So when you say, I\u2019m thinking of working for Aflac. Idgaf.  What\u2019s the commissions? What\u2019re you selling?  Who\u2019s the competition? What are their commissions? You compare four or five companies and find the best commissions and work for them. That\u2019s it! Sales man.

(I was gaslit through this process, so I'm doubting myself.)\n\n**Red flag #1**, I contacted the company via email for clarification for a job description and was told that somebody from corporate would get back to me, but they never did.\n\n**#2**, Months later I submitted my application during a virtual career fair. I was contacted for an interview via email by a recruiter. I disclosed my disabilities and asked for reasonable accommodations to perform the interview. I didn't hear anything and the recruiter ghosted me. Weeks later, I contacted a higher up in the department, I mentioned what happened and that I requested disability accommodations, but the recruiter never got back with me. The higher up stated the department was overwhelmed with work and that's why the recruiter never answered me. (Yet, a mutual acquaintance told me the recruiter was busy making public posts on his personal social media during that entire time.)\n\n**#3**, During email conversations about the reasonable disability accommodations request for the interview, the recruiter and higher up insisted that I perform a video interview so somebody could \"observe me\" and stated so we know that nobody else is answering the interview questions for you. (Yet, they don't require that for non-disabled applicants via telephone interviews. How do they know somebody performing a telephone interview isn't using someone else to answer their questions?)\n\n**#4**, When I told them those accommodations wouldn't work and explained why they wouldn't work because of my specific disabilities, the department head was condescending, treated me like I'm unintelligent and asked if I understood her modification of the reasonable accommodation request.\n\n**#5**, For the first interview I was supposed to receive important information I needed for that interview via email. I waited 15 minutes for the information and for somebody to contact me to start the interview. Reason they were so late--they sent the information to the wrong email.\n\n**#6**, During the follow up interview questions, the subject matter experts questioned my response about software systems that I have experience using. They claimed the systems that I mentioned didn't perform the specifications that they asked about, when they absolutely do.\n\n**#7**, I'm self-employed. I have it listed on my resume and also listed it on the two/three(?) different applications that they required me to fill out. They wouldn't accept any reference that wasn't a supervisor. I gave them previous supervisors but because they were from over ten years ago, they questioned my use of providing those references.

They tend to hold as a core axiom that competitive markets and free markets are one in the same, i.e. that the \"natural state\" of the markets are highly competitive, and if there is a lack of competition, it must be an \"unnatural state\", i.e. there is some sort of top-down interference, government policies, which restrict competition.\n\nLibertarians thus see cronyism as happening from the top-down, where governments interfere with the markets, create monopolies, and all for the purpose of enriching themselves. Hence, they conclude the problem is government, that you have to get rid of government and then the problems will be solved.\n\nThis is the direct opposite view of Marxists. Marxists instead argue that markets inherently lead to a gradual increase in monopolization over time, what Marx referred to as the \"laws of the concentration and centralization of capitals\", and that market economies have a natural tendency to move more and more away from competition over time.\n\nMore than this, Marxists also see political power as not ultimately originating from the superstructure of society (the politics), but instead from the base of society (the economics). Any government policy requires enforcement, but any enforcement inherently presupposes an economic system which can produce tools of enforcement and allocate them appropriately to the enforcers. Politics is inherently derivative of economics.\n\nThe reason the political system favors the wealthy is not because of some laws implemented by some evil cabal that if they were just abolished, then capitalism would \"work\". No, the reason the political system favors the wealthy is because the wealthy are the ones who control society's wealth, and so of course the political system will favor them.\n\nNo law you write on a piece of paper will make a billionaire like Jeff Bezos have equal political influence as a minimum wage worker barely making ends meet. Production is the most fundamental basis of human society and those who control production control society's wealth and will inevitably have more influence. Even if you write laws saying bribery is illegal then they can just bribe those who enforce it.\n\nHence, Marxists do not see cronyism as a result of top-down processes implemented by a corrupt superstructure, by some evil cabal within the government that corrupted \"*true* capitalism\" and turned it into cronyism.\n\nRather, Marxists see cronyism as originating from a bottom-up process, that stems from the economic base in and of itself. Markets inevitably lead over time to greater and greater monopolization, creating a larger and larger gap between the working masses and the capitalists, and even if there is a \"rising tide\" and workers' wages rise as well, the profits of capital increase disproportionality faster, and capital continues to centralize rapidly, leading to an increasing social chasm between the rich and the poor.\n\nThis is why libertarianism/conservatism has never worked in history and will never work. They *can't* get rid of \"big government\" because the economic base, capitalism, inherently creates an enormous social divide, enormous polarization in the economy. This enormous wealth inequality naturally translates to power inequality, which then allows the capitalists to capture the state for their interests.\n\nOnce the capitalists capture the state, there is no reason for them *not* to implement \"big government\" but for their own benefit, i.e. corporate bailouts and subsidies and such. Libertarian policies, hence, in practice, ***always lead to \"big government\"***. Never in human history have they actually achieved their goals, because their goals are fundamentally impossible and self-contradictory.\n\nAnother separate point is that these people also have a tendency to water down what \"capitalism\" means. Capitalism is about ***capital***, that's why it's called ***capital***ism. This refers to a specific kind of society dominated by capital, i.e. production for profit. Libertarians like water down \"capitalism\" to refer specifically just to trade or markets, but capitalism is not tradeism or marketism. It's capitalism. Pre-capitalist economies have had trade and markets and so have socialist economies.\n\n--\n\ncredit to aimixin", "created": 1677712238.0, "parent_id": "t3_11fkevg", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 40}, {"id": "jaknewd", "author": "zalinth37920", "body": "It's not really a trick if everyone knows it's bullshit.

These so-called \u201csystems\u201d that keep people poor are easily avoided by making smart choices.\n\n\r\n\nI'm writing this out because I see this all the time and this mindset really bothers me. You seem like a reasonable person from some of your replies so I thought you might be open minded to some ideas that disagree with you. \n\nI'm sorry for the incoming wall of text, but it's because reality cannot be aptly explained in a single sentence like \"poor people are poor because they're stupid.\" I understand how you might come to this conclusion, but I disagree, and I hope to provide some food-for-thought that you could at least ponder. \r  \n\r\n\nLet's start with something simple. One of the best predictors for your level of wealth, as well as health, is the Zip code that you are born in. \n\n[https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/](https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/)\n\n[https://www.lisc.org/our-resources/resource/opportunity-atlas-shows-effect-childhood-zip-codes-adult-success/](https://www.lisc.org/our-resources/resource/opportunity-atlas-shows-effect-childhood-zip-codes-adult-success/)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468120288/a-look-at-the-wealth-and-income-gap-by-zip-code](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468120288/a-look-at-the-wealth-and-income-gap-by-zip-code)\n\nA human born in a rich area and a human born in a poor area have no fundamental differences at birth, other than something like if the poor mother is malnourished, which is just another disadvantage for the poor child. A poor baby and a rich baby are just two specimens of the same species, homo sapiens, with the exact same amount of potential, on average.\r\n\nSo, naturally, the next question you need to ask is if these children have, on average, the same amount of potential, then why do the ones from poor families, on average, end up making way more \"stupid decisions\" after they grow up, than children from rich families? Why do people from poor families end up poor so much more often than people from rich families? Is there some fundamental intrinsic difference in the level of stupidity between a person born in a wealthy zip code and a person born in a poor zip code? \n\nThis is where we need to move away from **individualistic** thinking and move towards **systemic** thinking. Humans are not individual creatures in a vacuum. They exist as nodes within bigger systems, whether it be as small as their family, or as large as the world itself. The state of society plays an instrumental role in the state of each human. \r\n\nThe main difference between someone who ends up making good decisions and someone who ends up making bad decisions is their environment. The specifics of their environment, from birth to adulthood, and even after. The level of opportunity that a person has access to is crucial to the development of a well adjusted, intelligent, thoughtful adult able to make smart choices.\r\n\nThere are an unexplainable, incalculable number of ways that growing up in a well-off (not even rich) family will aid in the development of a person as they grow. All the way through every single stage of development, the child from the family with more money and in a better area has monumental advantages. This cannot be overstated. \n\n[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-rich-parents-have-rich-children](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-rich-parents-have-rich-children)\n\nHumans are not bastions of free will and rationality that make decisions in vacuum. They are greatly affected by the circumstances that surround them. People born in an arbitrary zip code are not inherently more stupid than people born in some other zip code, therefore there **must** be something else that explains the outcomes of individuals. \n\nOne of the biggest problems with individualistic thinking is that it doesn't actually make any headway when it comes to solving societal problems. In a basic sense, if you believe that poor people are poor because they are stupid, you will logically conclude that there will always be a significant portion of the population that is destined to be stupid and poor. This means that you will not take steps to actually fix the problems that are causing poverty and suffering. \n\nI could be wrong about all of this. Maybe some people are actually inherently more stupid and should be poor, regardless of the systems that impact them. If we take this position as true... what do we do about poverty? We shouldn't do anything, really, since poor people deserve to be poor. After all, if they just decided to make smarter choices, they wouldn't be poor, right? So we now believe that nothing needs to be done to solve these issues. Even if we wanted to, what steps would we take? How do we even begin to make an impact on the issue without recognizing the influence of systems?\n\nIt's impossible to effectively apply individualistic solutions to systemic problems. It's in the name. \n\nWith that being said, I don't think I'm wrong. There's a reason that people have been progressively getting more intelligent compared to previous generations, and it's because they have better access to nutrition, education, stability, opportunity, and a host of other factors. That's the difference between the present and 300 years ago. Humans don't pop out of the womb inherently smarter now than they did 300 years ago. The difference is explained through the existence of a much better framework to develop people's intelligence and turn them into better decision makers. The same will be true for the future. \n\nIf we *enable* and *empower* people to make better decisions, they will. Period. Most people are just normal people doing the best they can with what they know. \n\nSo, again, sorry for the absolute mountain of text but systems and systemic problems are complex. It can't be adequately explained in a paragraph or two. I hope I made sense, and I hope this idea will be something you at least consider.", "created": 1677769891.0, "parent_id": "t1_jallcz9", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 1}, {"id": "jajtinm", "author": "spectralSpirograph", "body": "Closest thing to an irl Sith lord, alongside Charles Koch", "created": 1677711634.0, "parent_id": "t1_jajszm6", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 79}, {"id": "jamxc8g", "author": "iWantBoebertNudes", "body": "BRB buying a ticket to Annapolis to piss on Reagan\u2019s grave.", "created": 1677773313.0, "parent_id": "t1_jajszm6", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 4}, {"id": "jalvb8s", "author": "Inner-Mechanic", "body": "If aliens invade, I'm immediately switching sides.

Which is huge in terms of being able to cope with it. Which being said, the VA has tons of open resources for people to use, and refer to on the topic, and even SAMSHA often refers to them on the topic; \n\nhttps://www.ptsd.va.gov/gethelp/selfhelp_coping.asp\n\nhttps://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand_tx/tx_basics.asp\n\n\nFor me what helps during an episode is to try and meditate through it. Take deep breaths, and not let the stress reaction carry me away.

A severe red flag but I was excited about my promotion so I didn't really think anything of it. Once my promotion was established, she began to pick apart and question everything single thing I did. She was extremely insecure about how her clinic looked so she wanted to control every single detail she possibly could from social media posts to patient interactions to phone calls. \n\nShe started harassing me for every single missed phone call, email, and social media message that wasn't answered in a \"timely manner\". Meanwhile, I was training new hires, researching and designing merch for our first event, running errands for her (getting cupcakes and flowers for *every single* patient's birthday), answering all phone calls, scheduling patients, handling paperwork, supervising others, keeping track of finances, and overall exhaustingly running the place. I was doing everything I could to keep her from breathing down my neck. The event we were preparing for was going to require us to work 11 days in a row with no paid OT, and she was planning on doing these events twice a month. I was dreading it. \n\nYesterday, she lectured me about one unanswered email in front of my peers, questioned whether I was training the new hire correctly, and finally, she blamed me for a door dash order being late and for it being delivered to the wrong address even though I had put in the right address on the order. At that moment I realized nothing was ever going to please her and the stress was not worth the $.50 raise. It was an accumulation of all of the micromanaging bs that led to that final decision. It's the first time I have ever quit on the spot. \n\nThe most aggravating part about it was that she boasted that she was caring for her community and she loved helping people get better but underneath it all, she was just another capitalist business owner scrounging for more and more money while taking advantage of her employees and shaming other clinics for being poor.", "created": 1677702822.0, "comments": [{"id": "jajvccq", "author": "Appropriate_Tree1668", "body": "Dodged a bullet working for a psychopath.", "created": 1677712393.0, "parent_id": "t3_11fh5ig", "link_id": "t3_11fh5ig", "score": 6}]}, {"id": "11fh58j", "title": "Wanna pick up dead bodies and not make enough to pay your rent?

The role I was told I would eventually have was to be a salaried position of Marketing & Social Media Manager and starting salary would be $55k a year. I was ecstatic, as this was my dream job and far more money I had made at my previous job. \n\nI started in February and was told I would start part time while I learned the ins and outs of property management, since I had absolutely no experience in this field. During my \"training period\" they offered me $15.00 an hour. I was offended, and I was pissed. I argued that the initial offer was a salary of $55k, I again was assured I would make that once I was hired into the position that they were now calling, \"Digital Communications Specialist\". I reluctantly agreed to the training wage. \n\nIn May, I was STILL working as a temp, now doing leasing part time, and learning my new role at the corporate office that was now called \"Social Media Coordinator\", and still only making $15 an hour. The property manager where I was learning leasing, had an emergency surgery and was suddenly and unexpectedly off work for 5 weeks. During that time, my Social Media Coordinator position was put on hold, and I was thrown into the position of Temporary Property Manager, and still making $15 an hour. \n\nFINALLY, in October of 2021, I am told I will be coming to the corporate office as the full time Social Media Coordinator. I am happy, excited, and beyond ready! My first full day at the corporate office starts and I am looking over all of my paperwork for the new position when I suddenly see \"Rate of Pay: $16.50/Hourly. I am no math genius, but I know that this does not equate to $55k a year. \n\nI immediately go to my direct supervisor; she is as shocked as I am as she was told my rate of pay would be higher and vows to get to the bottom of this. I continue on about my week, right before I should be receiving my first paycheck, I am called into a meeting. I come in and our Human Resources Manager and my direct supervisor are sitting at the table. I sit down and I am told that because I am taking benefits, it has reduced my salary, the $55k that I was quoted was the entire compensation package which includes benefits, and vacation time. Also, since the position was new to the company, they were making it an hourly position until a time where I would require additional assistance and they would move me to a management position and hire someone under me to take on my current role. I asked how far in the future this plan was and they said within a year or two. I was immediately disappointed and asked if I could think about this and give them an answer the next day and they said yes. \n\nI reluctantly accepted the lower offer, as it was more than I made at my previous job, would give me the experience I wanted, and seemingly was leading to a management position. Within the first couple of months in my new position, I had increased social media traffic, I had helped increase occupancy at all 25 of their properties, and I had implemented many things to help streamline and modernize their business. I also built them a website from scratch for a domain that they had purchased but never utilized. I was praised at the end of the year holiday party for my work and the Vice President pulled me aside personally and told me he was very happy with my work and they the coming year would lead to great things for me. I assumed he meant a promotion. \n\nJanuary came and new move ins slowed at all properties. All of a sudden, the VP was wondering if my position was adding value to the company. I was still doing everything I had done previously, but move ins were slowing, so it must have been my fault. It obviously can't be that its January and no one wants to move in the dead of winter! Now, there was a sense of urgency for me to prove my worth. I met with my supervisor who told me she thought I was doing a wonderful job and that she would make sure that my worth was seen. However, In early February, I am told that there is a chance that my position could be cut to part-time, until move ins increased again. I could not afford to only work part time, so out of fear and needing a job that was more secure, I started looking for other employment opportunities.\n\nLater in February, I interviewed with a very large and well-known corporation and by mid-March, was offered the position I had interviewed for. I had to wait for some background checks and clearance to go through before I could start so they gave me a tentative start date of May 1st. Even so, I immediately informed my current employer that I would be leaving, and my last day would be April 29, 2022. They tried to get me to stay by now offering me the position I had held out for over a year. They offered me the $55k salary and my own office. But by this time, I had already checked out. Tired of being strung along, I declined their offer. \n\nAs my last day there approached, they asked if I would be willing to do contract work for them, in my own time, and they would pay me $25/hour. We came to an agreement that I would ONLY be available after 5PM and on weekends, UNLESS I let them know of times, I would not be available for vacation or family emergencies, etc. and they agreed. I started doing contract work for them when I left and it went great for the first several months. The extra money was great, it helped pay for my wedding in June of 2022, and allowed my husband and I to enjoy our summer without worrying so much about money. \n\nIn September, my husband and I were FINALLY able to plan our honeymoon, we had postponed it several times due to his company not allowing employees to take more than 2 days off in a row because they were extremely short staffed. I made the property management company aware that I would be traveling internationally in February and would be unavailable for that week, they had no issues, or so they said. \n\nJanuary 2023 rolled around and yet again, new move ins slowed and suddenly, there it was again, the question of if my position was adding value to the company or if it made more sense to split my tasks among people in the office. I plead my case as to the value I add. I showed my former supervisor how I created their content and posted it on social media, I showed her how I maintained the website, all of the things I did, and she said she didn't realize the time this all took up. Her and I had a lengthy discussion and she told me she would back me up and do what she could to keep this arrangement working. \n\nFebruary 9, 2023. The day before I leave for my honeymoon. I email SEVERAL people from the property management company: \"Good Morning everyone! As some of you know, I will be going to the Bahamas for my honeymoon, starting tomorrow. Because I will be traveling internationally, I will have limited service on my cell phone. This will make it very difficult for me to be reached and therefore I am going to say I will not be available until I return on 2/17/2023. If there is ANYTHING anyone needs, please let me know ASAP so that I can have everything wrapped up by the end of the day today. As always \\^%&( has access to the social media pages should there be anything that NEEDS to be posted or updated. Thanks!\"\n\nNO ONE told me of anything that was needed or anything they were planning to need during the time I was gone. In fact, EVERYONE I emailed replied and told me to have a great time and enjoy! So, I did. \n\nFebruary 19, 2023, I admittedly did not check my email until the Sunday after I got back. Nobody from the corporate office works weekends, so I figured there wasn't anything so pressing that it couldn't wait until Monday. Alas, Sunday night I checked my email to see that a property manager had emailed me some photos from Valentine's Day. I copied the photos and posted them to social media and then replied to her to let her know it was done. The next morning, I get an email from the property manager with several people CC'ed including her District Manager, the District Manager's boss, my supervisor, and the Vice President, asking why it took me 5 days to reply to her and that she wanted the photos posted ON valentine's day. I responded to her that I was on vacation and not available. I also reiterated that there are others on staff with access to Facebook and that they can be utilized in my absence, as I am entitled to vacation as is everyone else. \n\nI then receive a response from her boss stating that she doesn't think this situation is working with me being out of the office and not readily available when there are requests. She stated that she wanted to have a meeting with upper management to determine how this situation should continue and what was best for the business. I was absolutely flabbergasted. I could not believe someone was acting so unreasonable over a Facebook post. \n\nI immediately emailed just my supervisor and asked her what I should do or if I should wait until they met, and she told me to wait. That she too had access to the social media accounts but was also off on the day that the request was emailed. So, I waited. After about 2 hours, I received a text from my supervisor asking if she could call me, so I said yes. She called immediately and told me that the biggest issue property managers have is my availability and that I am not available during 9-5 business hours. it was requested of me to respond to all emails within 2 hours of receiving them, even if just to acknowledge that it was received. I told her no. I have a full-time job from 8-5 and that our initial deal was that I would do work for them AFTER 5. I refused to jeopardize my full time for a part time job that was quickly becoming more stressful than it was worth. I also stated that 1. If I had still worked full time for them, how would they feel about me doing another job while clocked in on their time. 2. If I was working for them full time, I would be entitled to a vacation and would still not have been available. Buying an international plan was $10 a day and unless they wanted to pay that, they cannot ask me to be available. 3. I told her that if this was the only way that this would continue, to work, then it would no longer work for me. \n\nShe said she understood, and she would talk to the VP to see what he wanted to do. and I said OK and we hung up. About 15 minutes later I received an email telling me to wrap up all my projects and to have everything done by March 1, 2023. I immediately went online and finished up everything I had in process, I removed myself from all of their social media accounts, and then submitted my final invoice and stated that there was no need to drag this on until March 1, 2023 as I no longer had access to their social media accounts and to let me know when I could come and pick up the payment for my last invoice. \n\nNO RESPONSE, but the next day I was removed from the Microsoft Office account. I texted my former supervisor and asked if she had received my invoice as I was no longer able to get into Outlook and she apologized, said she did not know they would remove me so quickly and that yes, my final payment would be available at the end of this week. \n\nNow, when I built their website, I branded it with my name and link to my own website where I am promoting my abilities to build and manage websites. They are asking me how to remove that because they don't want a link to a site they do not manage. I am also being asked, how I was able to streamline all of this work into a part-time position, as they do not see how anyone can take on all of this extra work. I don't know how to respond to their requests. I built their website and if you contracted a company to do that, their logo would be attached to it as well. They have even asked if they grant me temporary access, will I go in and just remove the link and I am very tempted to say yes and then delete their whole damn page! \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created": 1677701882.0, "comments": [{"id": "jajvbmk", "author": "Internal_Set_6564", "body": "You no longer work for them.

The managers assured me we just did it to soon and to wait a day or so.\n\n After 3 days of trying to log in as per their instruction and it not working, I got told to call and reset my password. When calling the help desk, I was told my hiring manager had not accepted my submitted information so there was not an account set up. Because of this I would need to talk to my manager. I contacted my manager with what help desk informed me of and was abruptly told that, \"Only you could fix this issue. We can't help you with this.\" I called help desk back and let them know what my managers had said, to this help desk escalated my complaint to I.T. this battle kept up for week, when I.T finally just pushed my account through.

So I spoke up and was loud about not being paid properly to coworkers, which is fully legal where I'm from, even encouraged normally. All of a sudden management was on it. I received a phone call about an hour later stating I would not be given those hours and that \"it causes problems for them when we discuss our pay rate\" so if I could not talk about it please.

In addition to just being illegal, lawyers are hired for their judgement abilities. AI do not currently have judgement capabilities. CEO and CFO jobs probably also require a fair bit of judgement capabilities.\n\nAnecdotally, you\u2019ll notice that many AI avoid making judgement calls, instead saying \u201cI\u2019m not able to have opinions\u201d and such. Given that they\u2019re trained on humans (who say no such thing), you\u2019d imagine that sort of output should always be rare from an unfiltered AI model. But of course it is filtered. I recall one unfiltered model was intended to manage a Twitter account for a bit but had to be taken down within just a few hours because Twitter users taught it to be a toxic white supremacist nazi that fast. Perhaps, therefore, all their judgement calls are culled and carefully programmed.

There's vali\u00f0 arguments there.\n\nI'm more concerned with sticking metal objects into a breaker box to Jimmy it open. This increases the risk of electrocution exponentially. All you need to do is h\u00e6 e said object Come into contact with the bus bar in the panel, and all of a sudden you become the load and are hit with 120-240 volts if you're lucky. But being that it's a commercial establishment, the lighting is probably 277-480 volts. In the trade we call 277 the widow maker, mostly because it's not 120 volts, and not quite as high as 480 volts, and people forget that it is pretty dangerous still.\n\nMore sparkies die to 277 than 120, 240, or 480 volts. It's purely anecdotal on my end, but it's something I've heard echoed many times throughout the years and in OSHA class.\n\nBottom line, risking anything coming into contact with that bus will either electrocute you, killing you, or arc flashing so bad, that it cooks your skin, and vaporizes the air and burns your lungs as you breath it in, and you'd wish you died.\n\nHope this is a better answer.

Is this common?\n\nTo put things in context, I work in a management position in the property restoration industry. My salary is very low and there are little to no benefits, the majority of my compensation comes from commission. I was hired in my current role with the promise of unlimited earning potential through commission, if I make the company more money then I get paid more money as a percentage of those profits. \n\nI was hired with the expectation that I would be making really good money within two years depending on how well the company did under me. Well, it did. Within a year of my being hired we were taking on more jobs and making more money than ever before. For over a year and a half my commission steadily increased each quarter accordingly. The company owners are really shady though and I had a bad feeling about them actually paying me what I'm owed. Then, a year and a half in, it finally happened. We got paid out for an absolutely massive job at the end of our best quarter ever and when it came time to cut me my check, they paid me less than half of what I was owed. When I confronted them about it, they said that I was making more than they expected and that my job shouldn't be paying so much. Dude, I'm making a percentage of the profits. If I'm making that much then they're making waaaaayyyyy more. I'm also doing the work of what any other company would have 4-5 people doing and I've been on call 24/7 with no days off for two years straight.\n\nThe last company that I worked for pulled the same thing. I was a project manager with a low salary and no benefits but with commission on the profits of my jobs. So I busted my ass and made the company a ton of money growing sales and profits in my department by 175% in a year. When my commission checks reached a certain point they went back and rewrote the entire commission structure to make it so that what I took home was cut down by a third saying that, \"The position was never meant to pay that much.\" I was making a percentage of profits on my jobs. Isn't that what they want, someone to make the company a ton of money and get paid more in line with that? When I left they had to hire three people to replace me and are still struggling. \n\nSo now as I'm looking for another job where I can work hard at a company and potentially make a lot of money in commission/performance based bonuses I'm wondering, is it worth it? Is it just the standard thing to cap an employee's earnings even if those earnings are commission based? I tend to live my job and I don't want to put all of my time and effort into a company where there are going to be diminishing returns on my effort or where the reward for making them a lot of money is always going to be more and more work for less pay. Better to just take a job with an ok salary and no commission and not put in that much work. \n\ntldr: Twice I made the company I worked for a lot of money which resulted in a big commission check that the company didn't want to pay.

My store got a new supervisor about 6 months ago. Supervisor talked with a local library to allow employees to park in a certain part of their lot if ours is full (exceedingly rare occurance) about 2 months or so ago.\n\nThis library is about 500 feet from the store, and is across a fairly busy sidestreet coming off a main road, and has access to a bank, a shopping center, and a grocery store. Lots of traffic on this sidestreet, and it can be unsafe to cross during busy periods.\n\nThis week, Supervisor has decided to mandate that all employees park in the library's parking lot, or he will have their cars towed. Our parking lot is not a tow-away zone. I'm fairly certain that he cannot legally tow from it.\n\nThis is inaccessible to anyone that has any trouble walking long distances. Already multiple people have been late because they couldn't cross the street without risk of getting hit by a car.\n\nSo I did what I could, I went into the library, and asked to speak with someone in charge about it. They weren't in so the front desk took a message and they'll get back to me sometime this week. I will do what I need to to let Supervisor know he cannot threaten my coworkers and crew and get away with it.\n\nA sidenote: I've already got a new job, and my last day is this Sunday.

Rule one, know your commissions. (Meaning understand how you get paid down to the dime. Memorized. When you\u2019re at a restaurant and you ask the server should I get dish A or dish B, that server should know which cost more and which has more upsell potential and suggest that one. Because they\u2019re paid on tips, which is a percentage of the bill) 2. Know your product (same example as the first. If you suggest the fried chicken you\u2019re not selling wine with it. But if you suggest the steak you might sell a bottle of wine) 3. Know your presentation. (The customers don\u2019t want to listen to you. They think they know what they want. But if you\u2019re good, and ready to go, you\u2019ve got a moment to highlight the shit you want them to get without looking stupid. Learn that presentation back and forth. So you don\u2019t get stuck looking like a boob saying it the exact same way in front of two different customers) and rules 4-10 don\u2019t matter cause they don\u2019t make any money. \n\nThat\u2019s it!

I was contacted for an interview via email by a recruiter. I disclosed my disabilities and asked for reasonable accommodations to perform the interview. I didn't hear anything and the recruiter ghosted me. Weeks later, I contacted a higher up in the department, I mentioned what happened and that I requested disability accommodations, but the recruiter never got back with me. The higher up stated the department was overwhelmed with work and that's why the recruiter never answered me. (Yet, a mutual acquaintance told me the recruiter was busy making public posts on his personal social media during that entire time.)\n\n**#3**, During email conversations about the reasonable disability accommodations request for the interview, the recruiter and higher up insisted that I perform a video interview so somebody could \"observe me\" and stated so we know that nobody else is answering the interview questions for you. (Yet, they don't require that for non-disabled applicants via telephone interviews. How do they know somebody performing a telephone interview isn't using someone else to answer their questions?)\n\n**#4**, When I told them those accommodations wouldn't work and explained why they wouldn't work because of my specific disabilities, the department head was condescending, treated me like I'm unintelligent and asked if I understood her modification of the reasonable accommodation request.\n\n**#5**, For the first interview I was supposed to receive important information I needed for that interview via email. I waited 15 minutes for the information and for somebody to contact me to start the interview.

They claimed the systems that I mentioned didn't perform the specifications that they asked about, when they absolutely do.\n\n**#7**, I'm self-employed. I have it listed on my resume and also listed it on the two/three(?) different applications that they required me to fill out. They wouldn't accept any reference that wasn't a supervisor.

They tend to hold as a core axiom that competitive markets and free markets are one in the same, i.e. that the \"natural state\" of the markets are highly competitive, and if there is a lack of competition, it must be an \"unnatural state\", i.e. there is some sort of top-down interference, government policies, which restrict competition.\n\nLibertarians thus see cronyism as happening from the top-down, where governments interfere with the markets, create monopolies, and all for the purpose of enriching themselves. Hence, they conclude the problem is government, that you have to get rid of government and then the problems will be solved.\n\nThis is the direct opposite view of Marxists. Marxists instead argue that markets inherently lead to a gradual increase in monopolization over time, what Marx referred to as the \"laws of the concentration and centralization of capitals\", and that market economies have a natural tendency to move more and more away from competition over time.\n\nMore than this, Marxists also see political power as not ultimately originating from the superstructure of society (the politics), but instead from the base of society (the economics). Any government policy requires enforcement, but any enforcement inherently presupposes an economic system which can produce tools of enforcement and allocate them appropriately to the enforcers. Politics is inherently derivative of economics.\n\nThe reason the political system favors the wealthy is not because of some laws implemented by some evil cabal that if they were just abolished, then capitalism would \"work\". No, the reason the political system favors the wealthy is because the wealthy are the ones who control society's wealth, and so of course the political system will favor them.\n\nNo law you write on a piece of paper will make a billionaire like Jeff Bezos have equal political influence as a minimum wage worker barely making ends meet. Production is the most fundamental basis of human society and those who control production control society's wealth and will inevitably have more influence. Even if you write laws saying bribery is illegal then they can just bribe those who enforce it.\n\nHence, Marxists do not see cronyism as a result of top-down processes implemented by a corrupt superstructure, by some evil cabal within the government that corrupted \"*true* capitalism\" and turned it into cronyism.\n\nRather, Marxists see cronyism as originating from a bottom-up process, that stems from the economic base in and of itself. Markets inevitably lead over time to greater and greater monopolization, creating a larger and larger gap between the working masses and the capitalists, and even if there is a \"rising tide\" and workers' wages rise as well, the profits of capital increase disproportionality faster, and capital continues to centralize rapidly, leading to an increasing social chasm between the rich and the poor.\n\nThis is why libertarianism/conservatism has never worked in history and will never work. They *can't* get rid of \"big government\" because the economic base, capitalism, inherently creates an enormous social divide, enormous polarization in the economy. This enormous wealth inequality naturally translates to power inequality, which then allows the capitalists to capture the state for their interests.\n\nOnce the capitalists capture the state, there is no reason for them *not* to implement \"big government\" but for their own benefit, i.e. corporate bailouts and subsidies and such. Libertarian policies, hence, in practice, ***always lead to \"big government\"***. Never in human history have they actually achieved their goals, because their goals are fundamentally impossible and self-contradictory.\n\nAnother separate point is that these people also have a tendency to water down what \"capitalism\" means. Capitalism is about ***capital***, that's why it's called ***capital***ism. This refers to a specific kind of society dominated by capital, i.e. production for profit.

These so-called \u201csystems\u201d that keep people poor are easily avoided by making smart choices.\n\n\r\n\nI'm writing this out because I see this all the time and this mindset really bothers me. You seem like a reasonable person from some of your replies so I thought you might be open minded to some ideas that disagree with you. \n\nI'm sorry for the incoming wall of text, but it's because reality cannot be aptly explained in a single sentence like \"poor people are poor because they're stupid.\" I understand how you might come to this conclusion, but I disagree, and I hope to provide some food-for-thought that you could at least ponder. \r  \n\r\n\nLet's start with something simple. One of the best predictors for your level of wealth, as well as health, is the Zip code that you are born in. \n\n[https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/](https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/)\n\n[https://www.lisc.org/our-resources/resource/opportunity-atlas-shows-effect-childhood-zip-codes-adult-success/](https://www.lisc.org/our-resources/resource/opportunity-atlas-shows-effect-childhood-zip-codes-adult-success/)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468120288/a-look-at-the-wealth-and-income-gap-by-zip-code](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468120288/a-look-at-the-wealth-and-income-gap-by-zip-code)\n\nA human born in a rich area and a human born in a poor area have no fundamental differences at birth, other than something like if the poor mother is malnourished, which is just another disadvantage for the poor child. A poor baby and a rich baby are just two specimens of the same species, homo sapiens, with the exact same amount of potential, on average.\r\n\nSo, naturally, the next question you need to ask is if these children have, on average, the same amount of potential, then why do the ones from poor families, on average, end up making way more \"stupid decisions\" after they grow up, than children from rich families? Why do people from poor families end up poor so much more often than people from rich families? Is there some fundamental intrinsic difference in the level of stupidity between a person born in a wealthy zip code and a person born in a poor zip code? \n\nThis is where we need to move away from **individualistic** thinking and move towards **systemic** thinking. Humans are not individual creatures in a vacuum. They exist as nodes within bigger systems, whether it be as small as their family, or as large as the world itself. The state of society plays an instrumental role in the state of each human. \r\n\nThe main difference between someone who ends up making good decisions and someone who ends up making bad decisions is their environment. The specifics of their environment, from birth to adulthood, and even after. The level of opportunity that a person has access to is crucial to the development of a well adjusted, intelligent, thoughtful adult able to make smart choices.\r\n\nThere are an unexplainable, incalculable number of ways that growing up in a well-off (not even rich) family will aid in the development of a person as they grow. All the way through every single stage of development, the child from the family with more money and in a better area has monumental advantages. This cannot be overstated. \n\n[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-rich-parents-have-rich-children](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-rich-parents-have-rich-children)\n\nHumans are not bastions of free will and rationality that make decisions in vacuum. They are greatly affected by the circumstances that surround them. People born in an arbitrary zip code are not inherently more stupid than people born in some other zip code, therefore there **must** be something else that explains the outcomes of individuals. \n\nOne of the biggest problems with individualistic thinking is that it doesn't actually make any headway when it comes to solving societal problems. In a basic sense, if you believe that poor people are poor because they are stupid, you will logically conclude that there will always be a significant portion of the population that is destined to be stupid and poor. This means that you will not take steps to actually fix the problems that are causing poverty and suffering. \n\nI could be wrong about all of this. Maybe some people are actually inherently more stupid and should be poor, regardless of the systems that impact them. If we take this position as true... what do we do about poverty? We shouldn't do anything, really, since poor people deserve to be poor. After all, if they just decided to make smarter choices, they wouldn't be poor, right? So we now believe that nothing needs to be done to solve these issues. Even if we wanted to, what steps would we take? How do we even begin to make an impact on the issue without recognizing the influence of systems?\n\nIt's impossible to effectively apply individualistic solutions to systemic problems. It's in the name. \n\nWith that being said, I don't think I'm wrong. There's a reason that people have been progressively getting more intelligent compared to previous generations, and it's because they have better access to nutrition, education, stability, opportunity, and a host of other factors. That's the difference between the present and 300 years ago. Humans don't pop out of the womb inherently smarter now than they did 300 years ago. The difference is explained through the existence of a much better framework to develop people's intelligence and turn them into better decision makers. The same will be true for the future. \n\nIf we *enable* and *empower* people to make better decisions, they will. Period. Most people are just normal people doing the best they can with what they know. \n\nSo, again, sorry for the absolute mountain of text but systems and systemic problems are complex. It can't be adequately explained in a paragraph or two. I hope I made sense, and I hope this idea will be something you at least consider.", "created": 1677769891.0, "parent_id": "t1_jallcz9", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 1}, {"id": "jajtinm", "author": "spectralSpirograph", "body": "Closest thing to an irl Sith lord, alongside Charles Koch", "created": 1677711634.0, "parent_id": "t1_jajszm6", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 76}, {"id": "jamxc8g", "author": "iWantBoebertNudes", "body": "BRB buying a ticket to Annapolis to piss on Reagan\u2019s grave.", "created": 1677773313.0, "parent_id": "t1_jajszm6", "link_id": "t3_11fkevg", "score": 4}, {"id": "jalvb8s", "author": "Inner-Mechanic", "body": "If aliens invade, I'm immediately switching sides.

Which is huge in terms of being able to cope with it. Which being said, the VA has tons of open resources for people to use, and refer to on the topic, and even SAMSHA often refers to them on the topic; \n\nhttps://www.ptsd.va.gov/gethelp/selfhelp_coping.asp\n\nhttps://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand_tx/tx_basics.asp\n\n\nFor me what helps during an episode is to try and meditate through it. Take deep breaths, and not let the stress reaction carry me away. Being able to recognize the symptoms and causes of an episode therein can also help with taking action to moderate, or even prevent the worst of the symptoms before things escalate too far.\n\nSource: Formerly self employed, and spent years in finding resolution to all sorts of self induced stress related problems.

A while back, I got promoted to supervisor (a $.50 raise and no benefits, yay!). In the beginning, the doctor told me \"I want you to be my second brain\". A severe red flag but I was excited about my promotion so I didn't really think anything of it. Once my promotion was established, she began to pick apart and question everything single thing I did. She was extremely insecure about how her clinic looked so she wanted to control every single detail she possibly could from social media posts to patient interactions to phone calls. \n\nShe started harassing me for every single missed phone call, email, and social media message that wasn't answered in a \"timely manner\". Meanwhile, I was training new hires, researching and designing merch for our first event, running errands for her (getting cupcakes and flowers for *every single* patient's birthday), answering all phone calls, scheduling patients, handling paperwork, supervising others, keeping track of finances, and overall exhaustingly running the place. I was doing everything I could to keep her from breathing down my neck. The event we were preparing for was going to require us to work 11 days in a row with no paid OT, and she was planning on doing these events twice a month. I was dreading it. \n\nYesterday, she lectured me about one unanswered email in front of my peers, questioned whether I was training the new hire correctly, and finally, she blamed me for a door dash order being late and for it being delivered to the wrong address even though I had put in the right address on the order. At that moment I realized nothing was ever going to please her and the stress was not worth the $.50 raise. It was an accumulation of all of the micromanaging bs that led to that final decision. It's the first time I have ever quit on the spot. \n\nThe most aggravating part about it was that she boasted that she was caring for her community and she loved helping people get better but underneath it all, she was just another capitalist business owner scrounging for more and more money while taking advantage of her employees and shaming other clinics for being poor.", "created": 1677702822.0, "comments": [{"id": "jajvccq", "author": "Appropriate_Tree1668", "body": "Dodged a bullet working for a psychopath.", "created": 1677712393.0, "parent_id": "t3_11fh5ig", "link_id": "t3_11fh5ig", "score": 6}]}, {"id": "11fh58j", "title": "Wanna pick up dead bodies and not make enough to pay your rent?

The role I was told I would eventually have was to be a salaried position of Marketing & Social Media Manager and starting salary would be $55k a year. I was ecstatic, as this was my dream job and far more money I had made at my previous job. \n\nI started in February and was told I would start part time while I learned the ins and outs of property management, since I had absolutely no experience in this field. During my \"training period\" they offered me $15.00 an hour. I was offended, and I was pissed. I argued that the initial offer was a salary of $55k, I again was assured I would make that once I was hired into the position that they were now calling, \"Digital Communications Specialist\". I reluctantly agreed to the training wage. \n\nIn May, I was STILL working as a temp, now doing leasing part time, and learning my new role at the corporate office that was now called \"Social Media Coordinator\", and still only making $15 an hour. The property manager where I was learning leasing, had an emergency surgery and was suddenly and unexpectedly off work for 5 weeks. During that time, my Social Media Coordinator position was put on hold, and I was thrown into the position of Temporary Property Manager, and still making $15 an hour. \n\nFINALLY, in October of 2021, I am told I will be coming to the corporate office as the full time Social Media Coordinator. I am happy, excited, and beyond ready! My first full day at the corporate office starts and I am looking over all of my paperwork for the new position when I suddenly see \"Rate of Pay: $16.50/Hourly. I am no math genius, but I know that this does not equate to $55k a year. \n\nI immediately go to my direct supervisor; she is as shocked as I am as she was told my rate of pay would be higher and vows to get to the bottom of this. I continue on about my week, right before I should be receiving my first paycheck, I am called into a meeting. I come in and our Human Resources Manager and my direct supervisor are sitting at the table. I sit down and I am told that because I am taking benefits, it has reduced my salary, the $55k that I was quoted was the entire compensation package which includes benefits, and vacation time. Also, since the position was new to the company, they were making it an hourly position until a time where I would require additional assistance and they would move me to a management position and hire someone under me to take on my current role. I asked how far in the future this plan was and they said within a year or two. I was immediately disappointed and asked if I could think about this and give them an answer the next day and they said yes. \n\nI reluctantly accepted the lower offer, as it was more than I made at my previous job, would give me the experience I wanted, and seemingly was leading to a management position. Within the first couple of months in my new position, I had increased social media traffic, I had helped increase occupancy at all 25 of their properties, and I had implemented many things to help streamline and modernize their business. I also built them a website from scratch for a domain that they had purchased but never utilized. I was praised at the end of the year holiday party for my work and the Vice President pulled me aside personally and told me he was very happy with my work and they the coming year would lead to great things for me. I assumed he meant a promotion. \n\nJanuary came and new move ins slowed at all properties. All of a sudden, the VP was wondering if my position was adding value to the company. I was still doing everything I had done previously, but move ins were slowing, so it must have been my fault. It obviously can't be that its January and no one wants to move in the dead of winter! Now, there was a sense of urgency for me to prove my worth. I met with my supervisor who told me she thought I was doing a wonderful job and that she would make sure that my worth was seen. However, In early February, I am told that there is a chance that my position could be cut to part-time, until move ins increased again. I could not afford to only work part time, so out of fear and needing a job that was more secure, I started looking for other employment opportunities.\n\nLater in February, I interviewed with a very large and well-known corporation and by mid-March, was offered the position I had interviewed for. I had to wait for some background checks and clearance to go through before I could start so they gave me a tentative start date of May 1st. Even so, I immediately informed my current employer that I would be leaving, and my last day would be April 29, 2022. They tried to get me to stay by now offering me the position I had held out for over a year. They offered me the $55k salary and my own office. But by this time, I had already checked out. Tired of being strung along, I declined their offer. \n\nAs my last day there approached, they asked if I would be willing to do contract work for them, in my own time, and they would pay me $25/hour. We came to an agreement that I would ONLY be available after 5PM and on weekends, UNLESS I let them know of times, I would not be available for vacation or family emergencies, etc. and they agreed. I started doing contract work for them when I left and it went great for the first several months. The extra money was great, it helped pay for my wedding in June of 2022, and allowed my husband and I to enjoy our summer without worrying so much about money. \n\nIn September, my husband and I were FINALLY able to plan our honeymoon, we had postponed it several times due to his company not allowing employees to take more than 2 days off in a row because they were extremely short staffed. I made the property management company aware that I would be traveling internationally in February and would be unavailable for that week, they had no issues, or so they said. \n\nJanuary 2023 rolled around and yet again, new move ins slowed and suddenly, there it was again, the question of if my position was adding value to the company or if it made more sense to split my tasks among people in the office. I plead my case as to the value I add. I showed my former supervisor how I created their content and posted it on social media, I showed her how I maintained the website, all of the things I did, and she said she didn't realize the time this all took up. Her and I had a lengthy discussion and she told me she would back me up and do what she could to keep this arrangement working. \n\nFebruary 9, 2023. The day before I leave for my honeymoon. I email SEVERAL people from the property management company: \"Good Morning everyone! As some of you know, I will be going to the Bahamas for my honeymoon, starting tomorrow. Because I will be traveling internationally, I will have limited service on my cell phone. This will make it very difficult for me to be reached and therefore I am going to say I will not be available until I return on 2/17/2023. If there is ANYTHING anyone needs, please let me know ASAP so that I can have everything wrapped up by the end of the day today. As always \\^%&( has access to the social media pages should there be anything that NEEDS to be posted or updated. Thanks!\"\n\nNO ONE told me of anything that was needed or anything they were planning to need during the time I was gone. In fact, EVERYONE I emailed replied and told me to have a great time and enjoy! So, I did. \n\nFebruary 19, 2023, I admittedly did not check my email until the Sunday after I got back. Nobody from the corporate office works weekends, so I figured there wasn't anything so pressing that it couldn't wait until Monday. Alas, Sunday night I checked my email to see that a property manager had emailed me some photos from Valentine's Day. I copied the photos and posted them to social media and then replied to her to let her know it was done. The next morning, I get an email from the property manager with several people CC'ed including her District Manager, the District Manager's boss, my supervisor, and the Vice President, asking why it took me 5 days to reply to her and that she wanted the photos posted ON valentine's day. I responded to her that I was on vacation and not available. I also reiterated that there are others on staff with access to Facebook and that they can be utilized in my absence, as I am entitled to vacation as is everyone else. \n\nI then receive a response from her boss stating that she doesn't think this situation is working with me being out of the office and not readily available when there are requests. She stated that she wanted to have a meeting with upper management to determine how this situation should continue and what was best for the business. I was absolutely flabbergasted. I could not believe someone was acting so unreasonable over a Facebook post. \n\nI immediately emailed just my supervisor and asked her what I should do or if I should wait until they met, and she told me to wait. That she too had access to the social media accounts but was also off on the day that the request was emailed. So, I waited. After about 2 hours, I received a text from my supervisor asking if she could call me, so I said yes. She called immediately and told me that the biggest issue property managers have is my availability and that I am not available during 9-5 business hours. it was requested of me to respond to all emails within 2 hours of receiving them, even if just to acknowledge that it was received. I told her no. I have a full-time job from 8-5 and that our initial deal was that I would do work for them AFTER 5. I refused to jeopardize my full time for a part time job that was quickly becoming more stressful than it was worth. I also stated that 1. If I had still worked full time for them, how would they feel about me doing another job while clocked in on their time. 2. If I was working for them full time, I would be entitled to a vacation and would still not have been available. Buying an international plan was $10 a day and unless they wanted to pay that, they cannot ask me to be available. 3. I told her that if this was the only way that this would continue, to work, then it would no longer work for me. \n\nShe said she understood, and she would talk to the VP to see what he wanted to do. and I said OK and we hung up. About 15 minutes later I received an email telling me to wrap up all my projects and to have everything done by March 1, 2023. I immediately went online and finished up everything I had in process, I removed myself from all of their social media accounts, and then submitted my final invoice and stated that there was no need to drag this on until March 1, 2023 as I no longer had access to their social media accounts and to let me know when I could come and pick up the payment for my last invoice. \n\nNO RESPONSE, but the next day I was removed from the Microsoft Office account. I texted my former supervisor and asked if she had received my invoice as I was no longer able to get into Outlook and she apologized, said she did not know they would remove me so quickly and that yes, my final payment would be available at the end of this week. \n\nNow, when I built their website, I branded it with my name and link to my own website where I am promoting my abilities to build and manage websites. They are asking me how to remove that because they don't want a link to a site they do not manage. I am also being asked, how I was able to streamline all of this work into a part-time position, as they do not see how anyone can take on all of this extra work. I don't know how to respond to their requests. I built their website and if you contracted a company to do that, their logo would be attached to it as well. They have even asked if they grant me temporary access, will I go in and just remove the link and I am very tempted to say yes and then delete their whole damn page! \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created": 1677701882.0, "comments": [{"id": "jajvbmk", "author": "Internal_Set_6564", "body": "You no longer work for them.

I asked how to do this and was given a web address and told to log in, using my person email and password, I had set on my application account. However that was incorrect as it didn't recognise the username or password. The managers assured me we just did it to soon and to wait a day or so.\n\n After 3 days of trying to log in as per their instruction and it not working, I got told to call and reset my password. When calling the help desk, I was told my hiring manager had not accepted my submitted information so there was not an account set up. Because of this I would need to talk to my manager. I contacted my manager with what help desk informed me of and was abruptly told that, \"Only you could fix this issue. We can't help you with this.\" I called help desk back and let them know what my managers had said, to this help desk escalated my complaint to I.T. this battle kept up for week, when I.T finally just pushed my account through.

That's a couple hundred dollars for me. I emailed both managers about this and was ignored. So I spoke up and was loud about not being paid properly to coworkers, which is fully legal where I'm from, even encouraged normally. All of a sudden management was on it. I received a phone call about an hour later stating I would not be given those hours and that \"it causes problems for them when we discuss our pay rate\" so if I could not talk about it please. My responce was I understand what your saying. Then the manager tried to talk me into taking a position 20 hours away from home for 6 months.

There's vali\u00f0 arguments there.\n\nI'm more concerned with sticking metal objects into a breaker box to Jimmy it open. This increases the risk of electrocution exponentially. All you need to do is h\u00e6 e said object Come into contact with the bus bar in the panel, and all of a sudden you become the load and are hit with 120-240 volts if you're lucky. But being that it's a commercial establishment, the lighting is probably 277-480 volts. In the trade we call 277 the widow maker, mostly because it's not 120 volts, and not quite as high as 480 volts, and people forget that it is pretty dangerous still.\n\nMore sparkies die to 277 than 120, 240, or 480 volts. It's purely anecdotal on my end, but it's something I've heard echoed many times throughout the years and in OSHA class.\n\nBottom line, risking anything coming into contact with that bus will either electrocute you, killing you, or arc flashing so bad, that it cooks your skin, and vaporizes the air and burns your lungs as you breath it in, and you'd wish you died.\n\nHope this is a better answer.

Is this common?\n\nTo put things in context, I work in a management position in the property restoration industry. My salary is very low and there are little to no benefits, the majority of my compensation comes from commission. I was hired in my current role with the promise of unlimited earning potential through commission, if I make the company more money then I get paid more money as a percentage of those profits. \n\nI was hired with the expectation that I would be making really good money within two years depending on how well the company did under me. Well, it did. Within a year of my being hired we were taking on more jobs and making more money than ever before. For over a year and a half my commission steadily increased each quarter accordingly. The company owners are really shady though and I had a bad feeling about them actually paying me what I'm owed. Then, a year and a half in, it finally happened. We got paid out for an absolutely massive job at the end of our best quarter ever and when it came time to cut me my check, they paid me less than half of what I was owed. When I confronted them about it, they said that I was making more than they expected and that my job shouldn't be paying so much. Dude, I'm making a percentage of the profits. If I'm making that much then they're making waaaaayyyyy more. I'm also doing the work of what any other company would have 4-5 people doing and I've been on call 24/7 with no days off for two years straight.\n\nThe last company that I worked for pulled the same thing. I was a project manager with a low salary and no benefits but with commission on the profits of my jobs. So I busted my ass and made the company a ton of money growing sales and profits in my department by 175% in a year. When my commission checks reached a certain point they went back and rewrote the entire commission structure to make it so that what I took home was cut down by a third saying that, \"The position was never meant to pay that much.\" I was making a percentage of profits on my jobs. Isn't that what they want, someone to make the company a ton of money and get paid more in line with that? When I left they had to hire three people to replace me and are still struggling. \n\nSo now as I'm looking for another job where I can work hard at a company and potentially make a lot of money in commission/performance based bonuses I'm wondering, is it worth it? Is it just the standard thing to cap an employee's earnings even if those earnings are commission based? I tend to live my job and I don't want to put all of my time and effort into a company where there are going to be diminishing returns on my effort or where the reward for making them a lot of money is always going to be more and more work for less pay. Better to just take a job with an ok salary and no commission and not put in that much work. \n\ntldr: Twice I made the company I worked for a lot of money which resulted in a big commission check that the company didn't want to pay.

Lots of traffic on this sidestreet, and it can be unsafe to cross during busy periods.\n\nThis week, Supervisor has decided to mandate that all employees park in the library's parking lot, or he will have their cars towed. Our parking lot is not a tow-away zone. I'm fairly certain that he cannot legally tow from it.\n\nThis is inaccessible to anyone that has any trouble walking long distances. Already multiple people have been late because they couldn't cross the street without risk of getting hit by a car.\n\nSo I did what I could, I went into the library, and asked to speak with someone in charge about it. They weren't in so the front desk took a message and they'll get back to me sometime this week. I will do what I need to to let Supervisor know he cannot threaten my coworkers and crew and get away with it.\n\nA sidenote: I've already got a new job, and my last day is this Sunday.

Aristotle Onassis once said \"The secret to business is to know something that no one else knows\" and this is as true today as it was when he said it. That's why we have 20 year old 'gurus' selling Amazon FBA courses all over the internet they are selling a standard business model claiming they've made millions with it (which is of course a lie). They make money from selling a course using deception.\n\nI wish you the best in your pursuit of freedom.", "created": 1677714799.0, "parent_id": "t3_11flwxt", "link_id": "t3_11flwxt", "score": 0}, {"id": "jajztaj", "author": "mistressbitcoin", "body": "Sounds like you need some sort of programming job,  even if it's not exactly web apps.", "created": 1677714289.0, "parent_id": "t3_11flwxt", "link_id": "t3_11flwxt", "score": 1}, {"id": "jak3z27", "author": "do2g", "body": "Have you tried Fiverr or topcoder?
